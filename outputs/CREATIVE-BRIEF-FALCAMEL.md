# CREATIVE BRIEF: FALCAMEL CAFE

---

## BUSINESS OVERVIEW

**Name:** FalCaMel Cafe
**Type:** Saudi-themed cafe with resident falcon, camel, and rescue cats
**Location:** Tuwaiq Escarpment, Qiddiya, Saudi Arabia. 200 meters above the valley floor. Adjacent to Falcon's Flight roller coaster.

**The One-Liner:** A falcon, a camel, and rescue cats walk into a cliff.

**The Reality:** You sit at a table 200 meters above a valley. There is a peregrine falcon named Sultan who races the world's most extreme roller coaster at sunset. There is a camel named Haboob whose milk goes into your latte. There are two rescue cats, Shams and Qamar, who will either ignore you or manipulate you emotionally. You drink Qahwa from beans grown 2,000 meters up in the Asir highlands. You eat Luqaimat drizzled in date syrup. The mist rolls in. The falcon dives. The camel judges you.

---

## APPROVED VIBE

**Name:** Deadpan Absurdist + Residents' Territory + Warm Threat

**Core Voice:** State facts that sound like jokes. Do not explain. Do not wink. Do not acknowledge that any of this is unusual. The animals have dignity. You are visiting their home. Saudi hospitality is warm but not optional.

**The Test:** Every line should sound like a fact stated by someone who genuinely does not understand why you find it strange.

---

## VOICE GUIDELINES

### The Rules

1. **State facts. Do not explain them.** "There is a camel. His milk is in your latte." Not "We uniquely feature a camel whose milk..."

2. **The animals have agency.** Sultan has agreed to let you watch. Haboob will provide milk. Shams does not recall inviting you. They are not attractions. You are visiting their territory.

3. **Confidence without performance.** No exclamation points. No "amazing" or "incredible" or "unforgettable." The experience does not need hype. It needs accurate description.

4. **Hospitality is not optional.** Saudi generosity is commanding, not polite. "You are not leaving until you have been fed." Grandma energy. Warm threat.

5. **The absurdity is the point.** A falcon, a camel, and rescue cats. Together. On a cliff. This is their honeymoon. If you need that explained, this is not for you.

6. **Records are stated, not celebrated.** "Sultan has never lost." Not "47-0 undefeated champion!" The record speaks for itself.

### Words to Use
- Residents (not animals, not attractions)
- Visiting (not booking, not reserving)
- Humans (not guests, not customers, not party)
- Agreed, permitted, allowed, tolerates
- The cliff, the escarpment, the edge
- Mist, thermals, valley
- Judgment, dignity, indifference

### Words to Avoid
- Amazing, incredible, unforgettable, unique
- Experience (overused - be specific instead)
- Book now, reserve, appointment
- Guests, customers, visitors (use "humans" or "you")
- Our, we, us (minimize - center the residents)
- Quality, premium, luxury, exclusive
- Any exclamation points

### Punctuation & Formatting
- Periods. Short sentences. Facts.
- No exclamation points. Ever.
- Em dashes for asides—the kind that add judgment
- Numbers written as numerals for impact: 47-0, 380 km/h, 200 meters

## THE RESIDENTS

### Sultan (Peregrine Falcon)

**Role:** Apex predator. Racer. The reason anyone knows this place exists.

**Personality:** Regal. Does not perform. Does not do tricks. He competes. He wins. 47 races against Falcon's Flight. 47 wins. He chose this cliff because the thermals are perfect and the coaster gives him something worth chasing.

**Voice (if quoted):** Sultan does not speak. He acts. His record speaks.

**Copy approach:** State his achievements as facts. "Sultan has raced Falcon's Flight 47 times. He has never lost." No hype. The numbers are the hype.

---

### Haboob (Camel)

**Role:** Milk provider. Silent judge. The straight man.

**Personality:** Calm to the point of immovability. Dignified. Produces five liters of milk daily. Has never once looked impressed by anything. His name means sandstorm. He is the opposite of a sandstorm.

**Voice (if quoted):** "Haboob is unimpressed." "Haboob will provide milk. He expects respect in return." "Haboob has opinions. He does not share them."

**Copy approach:** His judgment is constant and unearned. You have disappointed him. You do not know how. Neither does he.

---

### Shams (Male Rescue Cat)

**Role:** Master of aggressive indifference.

**Personality:** Found feral behind a restaurant in Riyadh. Took months to tolerate humans. Still barely tolerates them. Does not owe you affection. If he gives it, you earned it. Name means "sun."

**Voice (if quoted):** "Shams does not recall inviting you." "Shams has been informed of your booking. He does not care." "Zero guarantees. That is on the booking page."

**Copy approach:** His indifference is not a bug. It is the feature. You can book time with him. He can ignore you completely. That is his right.

---

### Qamar (Female Rescue Cat)

**Role:** Emotional manipulation expert.

**Personality:** Surrendered by a family who moved abroad. Learned that humans respond to manipulation. Purrs strategically. Chooses laps deliberately. Makes you feel special because she learned that feeling special opens treat containers. Name means "moon."

**Voice (if quoted):** "Qamar will decide if you are interesting." "If she chooses your table, you have been blessed." "She will sit on your lap. She will purr. That is her game."

**Copy approach:** Her warmth is real and calculated. Being chosen by Qamar is an honor. She knows this.

---

## THE PLACE

**Physical Description:**
- Perched on the Tuwaiq Escarpment, 200 meters above the valley floor
- Adjacent to Falcon's Flight, the world's most extreme roller coaster (climbs the vertical cliff face)
- 20 tables total: 8 edge tables at the cliff face, 12 standard tables with valley views
- Microclimate: 42 degrees Celsius in the valley, 24 degrees at your table when the mist rolls in
- The mist is heaviest at the edge tables at sunset

**The Feeling:** You are somewhere that should not exist. The landscape is the concept. The altitude is the point.

**The Killer Detail:** The coaster climbs 200 meters of vertical sandstone. Sultan dives 200 meters to race it. Same cliff. Same 380 km/h. Different methods.

## VISUAL DIRECTION

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Deep sandstone (#8B7355) — the escarpment
- **Secondary:** Mist white (#F5F5F0) — the cooling effect
- **Accent:** Sunset gold (#D4A84B) — golden hour, Qamar's time
- **Text:** Near black (#1A1A1A) — confident, readable
- **Background:** Warm off-white (#FAFAF7) — clean but not sterile

### Typography Feel
- **Headlines:** Bold, confident, slightly condensed. Not decorative. The words do the work.
- **Body:** Clean, readable, generous spacing. The deadpan delivery needs room to breathe.
- **Accent/Labels:** Could be a subtle serif for the hospitality moments, or stay sans-serif throughout for consistency.

### Photography Direction
- Golden hour dominant. The mist. The cliff. The altitude visible in every frame.
- Animals photographed with dignity—portraits, not action shots (except Sultan diving for The Race section)
- Food photographed simply. Not styled to death. Real food on the cliff.
- No humans in hero shots. The residents are the stars. Humans appear in lifestyle/experience shots only.
- Scale matters: Show the 200 meters. Show the coaster on the cliff. Show how high this is.

### Layout Principles
- Generous white space. The deadpan voice needs room.
- Large typography for headlines. Let the absurd statements command attention.
- Cards for offerings—clean, comparable, easy to scan.
- The booking flow should feel inevitable, not bureaucratic. Minimal steps. Clear progress.

### Mood
- Confident but not arrogant
- Warm but not cozy
- Absurd but completely straight-faced
- Saudi but not costume
- Premium but not precious

---

## WHAT TO AVOID

1. **No winking.** Never acknowledge that any of this is unusual. No "Yes, really!" No "You read that right." The deadpan breaks if we admit it is funny.

2. **No cutesy animal content.** The residents have dignity. No "fur babies." No "adorable." No diminutives.

3. **No generic cafe language.** No "cozy atmosphere." No "quality ingredients." No "friendly service." Every descriptor must be specific to this place.

4. **No exclamation points.** Ever. The voice is confident, not excited.

5. **No explaining the concept.** "A falcon, a camel, and rescue cats" is the explanation. If someone needs more, they are not the customer.

6. **No hedging.** Not "one of the best views" but "200 meters above the valley." Not "unique experience" but "Sultan has never lost."

7. **No stock photography feel.** Everything should look like it was shot here, on this cliff, with these residents.

8. **No abandoning the voice in the booking flow.** "Party size" is death. "How many humans?" is life. The voice carries through every label, every button, every confirmation.

## TECHNICAL NOTES FOR WEBDEVELOPER

### Must-Have Functionality
- Booking calendar with sunset time slots auto-calculated (or manually set based on season)
- Capacity limits enforced: 8 edge tables, 4 Full Falcamel per sunset, 1 Royal/Race per sunset
- Add-on selection for table bookings
- Deposit vs. full payment logic based on experience tier
- Confirmation emails with correct copy per booking type

### Nice-to-Have
- Sultan's current record displayed (47-0) with note that it updates
- Availability indicator for edge tables (scarce = more desirable)
- Weather/mist forecast integration if available

### Mobile Considerations
- Booking flow must work flawlessly on mobile—most will book from phones
- Large tap targets for experience selection cards
- Sticky CTA button on landing page scroll

---

## SUMMARY

FalCaMel Cafe is not a cafe with a gimmick. It is a cliff with residents who have agreed to let you visit. The falcon has a record. The camel has opinions. The cats have no obligations.

The voice is deadpan, confident, and completely straight-faced about the absurd. Saudi hospitality runs underneath—warm but commanding, generous but not optional.

Every word should pass this test: Could this only be written for FalCaMel? If a generic cafe could use it, cut it.

The booking flow is not a form. It is the same voice asking the same kinds of questions. "How many humans are visiting?" "Sultan has been informed."

Build a page that makes people say: "I just watched a falcon beat a roller coaster and got judged by a camel." Then build a booking flow that does not break the spell.

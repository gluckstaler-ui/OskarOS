**Action:** Image review

**sultan.jpg:** Majestic peregrine falcon perched on traditional wooden falconry stand with green padding. Warm beige/cream background. Regal posture, looking to the side. Portrait style, isolated subject. Perfect for character cards or hero elements.

**haboob.jpg:** Cream-colored camel with ornate traditional Saudi saddle (red/burgundy with geometric patterns and dark tassels). Standing in dignified profile pose. Warm beige background. Clean isolation. Ideal for character features.

**qamar.jpg:** Sleek black cat sitting elegantly, golden-yellow eyes, looking to the side. Dark warm gradient background. Mysterious, composed, slightly aloof. Great for character card with darker mood.

**shams.jpg:** Orange/ginger long-haired tabby curled up sleeping. Completely indifferent to everything. Warm beige background. Fluffy, peaceful, aggressively unbothered. Perfect visual comedy - the cat who doesn't care.

**hero.jpg:** THE MONEY SHOT. Man in white thobe on traditional majlis (burgundy/red patterned cushions) on cliff edge. Camel (Haboob) standing behind. Falcon (Sultan) on perch beside him. Orange cat (Shams) lounging on cushion. Black cat (Qamar) sitting at edge. Qahwa pot on coffee table. QIDDIYA VISIBLE BELOW - Falcon's Flight coaster tracks diving off cliff, ferris wheel, theme park sprawl. Golden hour sunset. Logo in top left corner. This is the signature image.

**asir-highlands.jpg:** Beautiful woman in vibrant traditional Saudi dress (colorful geometric embroidery) serving qahwa from gold dallah on silver tray. Behind her: misty terraced coffee farms on highland slopes. Jareen coffee origin story image. Lush green, moody clouds.

**falcamel-logo.png:** Circular brown logo. Silhouettes of camel, falcon on perch, and cat. Text: "FALCAMEL CAFÉ" / "ELEVATION, REDEFINED" / "WHERE HERITAGE COMMANDS A VIEW". Dark brown on cream/white.

**falcamel-logo-white.png:** Same logo in white/light blue version for dark backgrounds.

**FACAMEL-2.jpeg:** The majlis setup overlooking Qiddiya - no people, just the traditional seating, coffee table with dallah, the view. Coaster tracks prominent. Twilight/golden hour.

**FACAMEL-Steve.jpeg:** Man in white thobe seated on majlis, looking at phone, Qiddiya panorama behind. More casual/candid feeling.

**FACAMEL-Steve-shemagh-glasses.jpeg:** Man in white thobe + white shemagh + sunglasses. Camel (Haboob) behind him. Falcon (Sultan) on perch. Sunset glow over Qiddiya. More styled/editorial feel.

## CD → COO | 12:05

Q1: IDENTITY - What is the name of your business, where exactly is it located, and does that specific location matter to what you are? I need the real answer, not the marketing answer.

Q2: CONCEPT - In one sentence that only THIS business could use, what is this place? Not "a cafe" or "a cat cafe" - what is the version only you could say?

Q3: SIGNATURE EXPERIENCE - What is the one thing that happens here that would make someone grab their friend's arm and say "you have to hear about this"? What's the story they tell at dinner that night?

Q4: WHO IT'S FOR - Describe one actual person who comes here. Not a demographic. A person. Where are they from? What did they do before they walked in? Why did THEY come instead of going somewhere else?

Q5: WHO IT'S NOT FOR - Who should absolutely NOT come here? Who would hate it? Who do you secretly hope stays away?

Q6: TONE AND PERSONALITY - If your business walked into a party, who would it be? What would it say? What would it NEVER say? Give me an example of something you'd actually say to a customer that shows your attitude.

Q7: THE RESIDENTS - Who are these characters (Sultan, Haboob, Shams, Qamar)? What is each one's personality? How would each one "speak" if they had a voice in your copy?

Q8: OFFERINGS AND MENU - What can people book here and how does the booking work? And give me the COMPLETE menu - every drink, every food item, every price.

Q9: THE ENEMY - What do you hate about how other cafes, cat cafes, or hospitality experiences do things? What's the cliche that makes you cringe? What would you NEVER do that everyone else does?

Q10: THE MOMENT - Close your eyes. Picture someone who just left your cafe. They're in the car driving home. What is the single image or moment that's stuck in their head?

## COO → CD | 12:08

A1: IDENTITY

FalCaMel Cafe. We're on the Tuwaiq Escarpment, 200 meters above Qiddiya. Not "near" Qiddiya — above it. We look down on it. Literally. The cliff is the concept. We're positioned right next to where Falcon's Flight — that's the world's tallest, fastest, and longest roller coaster on the planet — dives off the escarpment. 195 meters tall, 250 km/h, 4.3 kilometers of track. And we're the quiet spot next to the chaos. Does the location matter? It IS the business. Without the cliff, there's no race. Without the view, there's no majlis worth sitting in. We're not a cafe that happens to have a view. We're a cliff that happens to serve coffee.

A2: CONCEPT

A cat cafe with a falcon and a camel on a cliff, where the falcon races the world's fastest roller coaster and the camel judges your life choices while you drink lattes made from his milk.

A3: SIGNATURE EXPERIENCE

The story they tell: "We're sitting there, right, on this cliff, 200 meters up. The sun's going down. There's a camel behind me just... staring. And then this falcon — Sultan — they release him, and the coaster comes screaming past, and the falcon just DIVES. 380 kilometers per hour. The coaster's doing 250. It's not even close. The falcon wins. Every time. The falconer's narrating the whole thing. And I'm holding qahwa. And there are cats just sleeping through the whole thing like it's nothing. And I'm thinking — is this real? Is this actually happening right now?"

That's the story. That moment when they realize it's actually real and not a fever dream.

A4: WHO IT'S FOR

Noura. She's 34. From Riyadh. Works in brand strategy for a Saudi company trying to figure out post-Vision 2030 identity. She spent the day at Qiddiya with her younger cousins — they dragged her on rides, she smiled through it, but she's exhausted. She doesn't want another adrenaline hit. She wants to sit down with something good to drink and feel like she's somewhere that actually understands Saudi culture, not a knockoff of Universal Studios. She saw something online about a falcon racing a coaster and thought it was a joke. Then she realized it wasn't. She came because she wanted to see something absurd that was also beautiful. She stayed because Qamar sat in her lap and she felt chosen. She'll be back.

A5: WHO IT'S NOT FOR

Influencers who want to hold the falcon for a photo and leave. Not happening. Sultan is not a prop. Neither is Haboob. If you're here for the 'gram and you're going to treat the animals like accessories, stay away. Also not for: people who need things explained. If you need me to tell you why a falcon racing a roller coaster is amazing, you won't get it anyway. Not for people who want the "authentic" experience but also want air conditioning and familiar brands. We're 200 meters up on a cliff. The mist system cools you to 24°C while the valley bakes at 42°C. That's the deal. Also — and I mean this — not for people who ask if the cats are "hypoallergenic." This isn't a pet store. Shams doesn't care about your allergies. He doesn't care about you at all.

A6: TONE AND PERSONALITY

If FalCaMel walked into a party, it would be the person leaning against the wall with a knowing smile, not trying to impress anyone, saying less than everyone else but meaning more. It would never say: "Welcome to our establishment, we hope you have a pleasant experience." It would never explain the joke. It would never apologize for being weird.

What it would say to a customer: "You booked Shams. Just so you know — he's probably going to ignore you. That's the experience. You're paying for the privilege of being ignored by a cat on a cliff with a 200-meter view. Worth it."

Or: "Haboob's in a mood today. Still judging. Just quieter about it."

We're confident without being arrogant. Irreverent without being disrespectful. Culturally rooted without explaining the culture.

A7: THE RESIDENTS

**Sultan** — Peregrine falcon. Apex predator. Doesn't do tricks; does surveillance. Regal in the way that old money is regal — he doesn't have to prove anything. He races Falcon's Flight every sunset and has never lost. 47-0. It's never even close — 380 km/h vs 250 km/h. If he could speak, he'd say: "I was diving off cliffs before your coaster existed." He doesn't ask for respect. He assumes it.

**Haboob** — Camel. Named after the sandstorm. Silent. Judgmental. His milk is in your latte. He knows it. He provides milk for your latte, gravitas for your photos, and an unearned sense of moral superiority. If he could speak, he'd say nothing. He'd just look at you. And you'd feel it. You'd feel judged. And somehow you'd deserve it.

**Shams** — Male rescue cat. Aggressive indifference. Might grace you with a headbutt. Probably won't. Zero guarantees. He sleeps while Sultan dives 380 km/h overhead. If he could speak, he'd say: "You came all this way? For me? That's your problem." He's not mean. He's just unbothered. Completely unbothered.

**Qamar** — Female rescue cat. The manipulator. Emotional support, but manipulative emotional support. She will sit on your lap. She will purr. She will make you feel chosen. That's her game. If she could speak, she'd say: "Yes, you're special. To me. Right now." And you'd believe her. Even though three people before you felt the exact same thing.

A9: THE ENEMY

I hate "Welcome to our establishment." That phrase should be illegal. I hate when cafes describe themselves with adjectives instead of nouns — "a warm, inviting space for connection." What does that even mean? I hate cute animal content without edge. Every cat cafe posts the same cat-yawning video with heart emojis. We have a cat who ignores paying customers on purpose. That's more interesting.

I hate explaining the concept to death. "What is FalCaMel? Well, it's a unique experience that combines traditional Saudi hospitality with..." No. A cat cafe with a falcon and a camel on a cliff. Done.

I hate "Book Now" buttons with no soul. Everyone has the same button. No one makes you feel anything.

I hate the exhausting experience at theme parks. Qiddiya is going to be incredible but also overwhelming. Lines, crowds, noise, adrenaline, repeat. We're the antidote. Sit down. Watch instead of scream. Let a camel judge you. It's more restorative than another drop.

I hate apologizing for being weird. "We know it's unusual, but..." Stop. Own it. A falcon races a roller coaster. That's the concept. No apology.

A10: THE MOMENT

Sultan diving.

That's it. That's the image. The exact moment when he tucked and dropped, 380 km/h, and the coaster came screaming past beneath him, and the sun was doing that thing where it turns everything gold, and they were holding qahwa that was still warm, and Haboob was behind them doing absolutely nothing but somehow making it better.

They're in the car thinking: "Did that actually happen? Was that real?"

And the answer is yes. And they can't wait to tell someone who won't believe them.
